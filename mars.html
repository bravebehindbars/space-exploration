            <h1>The Violence of Space

            </h1>

                So why Mars? Did you know we now have the technology to send people to Mars and build colonies on the
                red planet? Well, the honest truth is, Mars isnâ€™t exactly the ideal place to establish a colony of
                people. That being said, to ensure the survival of our species, creating a colony of people anywhere off
                this planet is necessary. Our options include the moon, which has extreme temperature variations; a very
                large space station, which is costly; and Mars, the closest somewhat habitable planet. Mars can
                potentially be terraformed to support human life. How can you help? By spreading awareness globally.
