                Few people really know just how fragile life is. Many take life for granted because for thousands
                and thousands of years humanity has been here, so when scientists make claims expressing the
                importance of space travel for the survival of people, many people ignore it. Governments around the
                world don’t want to spend the money on something as expensive as space travel when there appears to
                be no inherent need for it. But as we peer deeper and deeper into space, seeing just how alone we
                are, we’re also finding new worlds like never before. But what scientists are seeing is vast
                emptiness. Around almost every star we can see in the night sky has planets circling it, but so far
                they all appear to be empty. The more we peer farther and farther into space, the more we study
                space, we see just how violent and unforgiving it is. As far as we know, life is unique to this
                planet. At least a complex life. And space becomes more and more hospitable and dangerous the more we
                learn about it.
